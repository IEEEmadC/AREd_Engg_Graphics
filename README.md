# AREd_Engg_Graphics
## What is it?
Its an android app that helps you learn subjects that require a lot of visualization, like Engineering Graphics. We figured that students will have an easier time learning such subjects if they had a tool to easily visualize the answers. In the app you have the choice of using the textbook which you can download [here](https://github.com/kryacose/AREd_Engg_Graphics/blob/master/ASSETS/AREdTextbook.pdf) or on its own by creating your own solids in-app. We've used Augmented Reality (AR) because we felt it was a fun and efficient way to visualize complex 3D solids on our phones.

## Why we made it?
Being engineering students ourselves had to learn graphics the old way, using pencil and paper. We found that most students found it difficult to actually visualize what they were drawing without any aids, terms like front-view and top-view meant all the same to them, and as questions got progressively tougher with more shapes and perspectives we began struggling ourselves. The app is our solution to this problem.

## Technologies Used
### Unity:
Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies. It supports various platforms like Android, iOS, Windows etc. For all scripting purposes within the app we have used C#. We chose unity as our platform because its easier to build Android apps and it has the Vuforia SDK built-in.
### Vuforia:
Vuforia is an augmented reality software development kit for mobile devices that enables the creation of augmented reality applications. It uses computer vision technology to recognize and track planar images and simple 3D objects, such as boxes, in real time. We have used the Vuforia Augmented Reality SDK for all our AR and image detection purposes.
### Google Sketchup:
Google SketchUp, is a 3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications such as architectural, interior design, landscape architecture, civil and mechanical engineering, film and video game design. We have used Sketchup for designing 3D models needed for the answers in the Textbook mode of the app.
### CAD:

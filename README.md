# AREd_Engg_Graphics
## What is it?
Its an android app that helps you learn subjects that require a lot of visualization, like Engineering Graphics. We figured that students will have an easier time learning such subjects if they had a tool to easily visualize the answers. In the app you have the choice of using the textbook which you can download [here] or on its own by creating your own solids in-app. We've used Augmented Reality (AR) because we felt it was a fun and efficient way to visualize complex 3D solids on our phones.

## Why we made it?
Being engineering students ourselves had to learn graphics the old way, using pencil and paper. We found that most students found it difficult to actually visualize what they were drawing without any aids, terms like front-view and top-view meant all the same to them, and as questions got progressively tougher with more shapes and perspectives we began struggling ourselves. The app is our solution to this problem.
